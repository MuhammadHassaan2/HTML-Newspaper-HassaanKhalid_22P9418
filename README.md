multiple columns, advertisement sections, headlines, and article blocks.

## Project Description

The goal of this assignment was to recreate a newspaper front page using
semantic HTML structure and table-based layout techniques. The design
imitates the dense column structure of older Urdu newspapers published
before 1990.

Inline styling was used to format borders, alignment, and spacing while
keeping the implementation limited to HTML only.
